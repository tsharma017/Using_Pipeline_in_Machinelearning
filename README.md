# Using_Pipeline_in_Machinelearning

A machine learning pipeline is a sequence of data transformation and model training steps organized into a single workflow. Each step in the pipeline is modular, meaning it performs a specific task such as preprocessing, feature selection, or model training. Pipelines help automate and streamline the workflow, reducing the chance of errors and making the process reproducible.

Without a pipeline, you need to manually handle each step in the workflow, such as scaling features, training the model, and predicting. This process can become cumbersome and error-prone, especially when working with complex transformations or multiple models.
